                                <p style="text-align:justify">Thiruvalluvar is a celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher whose contribution to Tamil literature is the Thirukkural, a work on ethics. He was born either in Thiru Mylai (Mylapore) Chennai in Tamil Nadu or in ThirunayanarKuruchi, a village in Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu.Thiruvalluvar is thought to have lived sometime between the 3rd century BC and the 1st century BC. The Tamil poet Mamulanar of the Sangam period mentioned that Thiruvalluvar was the greatest Tamil scholar and Mamulanar also mentioned the Nanda Dynasty of northern which ruled until the 4th century BC. This estimate is based on linguistic analysis of his writings, as there is no archaeological evidence for when he lived. He is sometimes also called Theiva Pulavar ("Divine Poet"), Valluvar, Poyyamozhi Pulavar, Senna Pothar,Gnana Vettiyan or Ayyan. Thirukkuṛal itself does not name its author or authors. The name Thiruvalluvar is first mentioned in the 10th century in a text called Thiruvalluvarmaalai ("Thiruvalluve traditions of Thiruvalluvar" appeared after this text had been written.[7] It is generally believed that the name Thiruvalluvar consists of Thiru.

                                    <p style="text-align:justify">Thirukkural is one of the most revered ancient works in the Tamil language. It is considered a 'common creed', providing a guide for human morals and betterment in life. Thirukkural has been translated into several languages, including a translation into Latin by Constanzo Beschi in 1730, which helped make the work known to European intellectuals.
                                    Thirukkuṛaḷ is a combined word formed by joining the two words Thiru (meaning revered) and Kural (is a form of poem writing style, like Ballad English Poems. Other forms of poem writing styles in Tamil are Venpa, Yaappu etc.)
                                    Thirukkuṛaḷ is divided into three sections: section one deals with Aram, good ethical behavior with conscience and honor ("right conduct"); section two discusses Porul, the right manner of conducting worldly affairs; and section three dwells on Kaamam, love between men and women. The first section has 38 chapters, the second 70 chapters and the third 25 chapters. Each chapter consists of 10 couplets or kurals, for a total of 1330 couplets. Although two sections, Aram and Inbam, are devoted to the private life of an individual more than   half the couplets in Thirukural are grouped under Porul which discusses ethics in public life. Thus Thiruvalluvar gives more importance to righteous living in public life.
